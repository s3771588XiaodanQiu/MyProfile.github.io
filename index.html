<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>My interest in information technology stems from my belief that everyone in this era cannot do without technology, especially me. Information technology is essential for the future development. This idea started when I was in my third year of senior high school, because there was still one year to go to university at that time, I had to think about what major to study in the future. The reason why I chose to study information technology firmly was that on my plane flying from China to Australia, an uncle sitting next door asked me what subject I was going to study in University, and I answered him I will choose design or information technology. Then he gave me a suggestion. He said that it is difficult to find a job after graduation if he studies design, but information technology is the mainstream in the future and the market demand is large. Everything depends on technology. And my IT experience is just what I study in RMIT foundation.
<p>The main reason why I choose RMIT is that it is close to my home, and I think the information technology major here is very good.
<p>I am looking forward to learning how to write programs and information technology related knowledge in the future university period. It would be better if I could learn how to make software.

<p>This position is a game programmer, need to develop games for online, mobile and tablet PC devices. This is a newly established high-tech company.

I plan to use the three years of college time to learn and master the ability required by information technology, as well as the ability required for this position. Learn as much as I can.
<h1>Personal profile</h1>
<p>The results of an online Myers-Briggs test: Adventurous 88%
<p>The results of an online learning style test: Visual learner
<p>The score of an online creativity test: 49.37
<p>The results of these three tests will affect whether the company employs me. My various abilities will affect my contribution in the group. For example, my spirit of adventure is very strong, and the members of the team are on the contrary. Then I choose innovation and others choose stability. When building a team, I think the test results should be divided into similar groups.
<h1>Project idea</h1>
<p>Unity is today's most popular game development tool. It is a comprehensive game development platform that can easily create interactive content such as 3D video games, architectural visualization and real-time 3D animation. It is a fully integrated professional game engine. It is a very mature game development tool, providing a perfect platform for people who want to develop games. I want to use Unity to make a mobile game that everyone would like. This is not an ordinary game, but also a game for people to communicate with each other.
<p>A new Digital 2020 reports show that digital, mobile, and social media have become an indispensable part of everyday life for people all over the world. At present, more than 4.5 billion people use the Internet, and social media users have exceeded the 3.8 billion mark. Nearly 60% of the world's population is already online, and the latest trend shows that more than half of the world's population will use social media by the middle of this year. Many people all over the world use social software to make friends, and I want to design this game is to let you play the game at the same time meet the players in the game, and the interaction in the game can greatly increase the favor of each other.
<p>I imagine the background of this game is that players are descendants of the Empire and need to find the forgotten culture in a lost empire. This game will have a great view, it allows players to make friends and chat on it, can play together in the map, give each other gifts, and collect star fragments to exchange clothes and hair styles. In this game, there will be five maps to explore: "the desert of monsters", "the sacred Palace", "the quiet rain forest", "the garden of birds and flowers" and "the beautiful cliff in sunset". You can run and fly when search of lost civilization. If you want to be friends with players, you need to give each other a star made up of star fragments. After being friend, you can unlock hand holding, hugging and other interactive ways. You can also lead each other's hand to explore and overcome various difficulties when playing games. At the same time, not only to bring players a good visual experience, background music is also very important. The combination of good picture and soft music can bring players a better game experience. Each map has different music, people have a memory for music, when players hear this music, they will remember a previous adventure in this map. The player's task is to gather all the lost civilizations. Each civilization has its own items. If a player wants to get some clothes or hair, he must first find the civilization corresponding to the item. Exploration requires energy, and each level will increase the energy bar, and the way to upgrade is to find the lost light in each map as much as possible.
In this game, star fragments are the equivalent of money, star fragments will be updated every day, so players can run each map to collect star fragments every day. 10 pieces of star fragments can form a star, and the stars can be used to exchange items. When you have collected all the lost light, you can choose to contribute the lost light you have collected and start the journey again. Of course, the collected civilization will not be lost. What you contribute is just the lost light. However, it is not without reward. After you have contributed, you will get meteors and can exchange for special things. Then you can collect the lost light again. This game encourages players to take the initiative to approach and communicate. In the game, the interaction between strangers will make people have a wonderful feeling, warm people's hearts, so that people who are not good at talking can also open their hearts. The most important purpose of this game is that players need to cooperate with partners to complete their final mission. But it is very difficult to complete the game, because it is too complex, it needs good design to complete the exquisite picture, needs professional music team to produce background music, needs complex programming, and needs a large amount of investment.
<p>Unity is a very powerful game development platform that I can use to make my games. This game mainly uses C language development, needs the developer to have the full utilization ability to the C language. Using DEV-C + + to write programs to make games is a good choice. Also, we need game artists to make beautiful pictures, and developers need to use hand-painted, PS, 3dmax and other software. Design and production of game characters, scenes, animation, special effects. Of course, background music developers need a high level of music skills and need to use music production software, such as FL studio.
<p>First of all, the development of a game requires game planners to write background stories for the game, formulate game rules, design game interaction links, calculate game formulas, and all the details of the whole game world. Secondly, making this game requires sufficient programming ability to use Dev-C + + software, because the game is very complex and requires high-level developers. Third, painting technology is also necessary, this game has a beautiful picture, developers should have the ability to use Photoshop and other software. Finally, developers need enough music production ability to use music production software to create background music.
<p>In general, if the game is successful, it will be fun for people. People can get to know each other, know each other well and feel the warmth from strangers in the game. Let people from all over the world interact and talk in the game, and make people who can't have intersection become friends. For example, some people are not good at talking in reality, so they often release themselves in the game. Then this game can help them talk to people, and at the same time, they can start to communicate with people.
